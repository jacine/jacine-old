I didn’t see Larry’s presentation, but I did read his recent post, [On Drupal Leadership](https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/on-drupals-leadership). Since I was mentioned in this post and comments, I’ve decided to respond with more detail.

First, I completely agree with Larry’s description of the Initiative Leader role being a “glorified secretary” role. I say that as a female who spent years in the corporate world as an actual secretary, and I’m not knocking the secretary role. Anyone who has been a secretary knows it’s an important role, so it’s hardly offensive. However, when you sign on for a job that contains the word “leader,” you don’t expect to spend the majority of your time doing tasks that literally fit the job description of a “secretary.” And when you are a “leader” with no actual authority, well that’s where the “glorified” part applies.

There are so many reasons why I left. I got into some of them at a very high level in [this post](/post/24652270662/core), specifically trying to curb the negativity, and do so quietly, so as to not discourage some of the great work that was being done by a small handful of front-end contributors. I had no idea that I was being “elbowed out”, and while there was and always has been “heated criticism” around issues and ideas, it was never that, that drove me out. As shitty as it is sometimes, that comes with the territory. The final straw was when it got personal, and my own thoughts and beliefs were policed and I was publicly shamed for negative comments because as an initiative lead, I should not been saying such things. Fuck that.
Two years later, a few of things that I’ve learned have really stuck with me:


1. Unless you work for Acquia, or an employer that sponsors your time 100%, you contribute at great professional risk and personal cost. Personally, I started to feel like an unpaid Acquia intern, which sucked, despite how much the work was appreciated or not.
2. When you stop contributing a large portion of your life to this software you are forgotten about pretty quickly. In the end, what’s most important is client work, and letting that suffer while putting contributions first was a mistake.
3. You know that saying: “Come for the software, stay for the community.” Well, the reverse applies just as much, and in my experience, I learned that very few of these people were actually my “friends” despite contributing and collaborating on core for 3 years on a daily basis.

So, depending on your situation, your mileage will definitely vary.

Since I left, I worked on a few client projects, including spending a year with Tag1 Consulting (the best team of Drupal professionals I’ve worked with). Then I took a year off while spending 40 weeks pregnant and now have a beautiful 5 month old baby girl. And Drupal 8 just got into beta. LOL. So, yeah… I don’t regret leaving at all.

Instead of re-hashing what I felt back then in retrospect, I’ve decided to share a personal email that I wrote 2 years ago while it was all still fresh because I stand by every word today. It’s a reply to a member of the community that asked me what I found frustrating and what ultimately made me leave the Initiative Lead role:

- I originally thought the role was going to come with authority and even commit access. Instead, the role was literally cat-herding, with a slightly louder voice than everyone else and no authority to actually get shit done.
- The leadership community (mostly Acquia employees) is trying to manage initiatives using Agile methods, including Project managers and sprints, etc. For me, this resulted in constantly feeling pressured to produce results, while not being able to actually control any of the work that was or wasn’t taking place because obviously Drupal contributors are mostly transient volunteers, and definitely not full-time employees.
- There is a lack of understanding and interest in front end development in general and as it pertains to Drupal among the core developer community. It’s something most of them happily ignore as unimportant enough that they don’t need to wrap their brains around it. Simple things need to be explained repeatedly.
- There is abuse of issue queue “rules” going on daily, which results in many issues not being accurately prioritized and categorized. HTML5 Initiative issues were mostly categorized as feature requests and even documentation update, when they clearly were not. The issues were frequently left to sit in the RTBC queue waiting for “real” major issues to be resolved.
- There’s a lack of resources and contributors available to help with front-end goals and promises to get additional help in the issue queue never came through.
- Simple issues take months and months of back and forth catty nonsense and dick measuring in the issue queue to resolve, which is extremely frustrating and demotivating for everyone involved.
- The job of Initiative owner requires at least 25-30 hours a week to do well, which is damn near impossible to do without being sponsored by an employer. I did it for over 9 months after going freelance, and saw my income decline, and the steady work that I had previously disappear. I’ve still not recovered from this.
- You have to pour countless hours into research, keeping up with the issue queue, trying to flesh out and propose ideas, motivating others to contribute even when you’re not motivated yourself.
- You have to be willing to travel. People will pressure and expect you to shell out the thousands of dollars of cash to pay for these trips. The fact that I don’t like public speaking, combined with the loss of income, made this a nightmare for me. I was constantly disappointing people by saying no to attend or speak at events.
- There are geek cliques and out of control egos galore. Some of it comes with the territory, but there’s a lot of high school bullshit that I want no part of.
- When you have a high visibility role in a project like Drupal you are expected to maintain a certain level of professionalism, no matter what. Speaking negatively about Drupal is discouraged (not forbidden, but strongly discouraged) unless it’s also accompanied by a plan to “fix” the problems.
- More and more core developers don’t work as developers on actual Drupal sites anymore, so they drift further and further from the day to day implications of the code they write. I find this troubling and don’t want to head down that path.
- A few front end developers in the Drupal community spend more time advertising their own contrib projects than anything else. It’s embarrassing and has started this whole trend of people that pit one project against another. People blindly rely on these themes instead of actually being creative and innovative. It seems like a big departure from where the community was a few years ago.
